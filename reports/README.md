# Reports

All report files will go into this directory. The Bash script,
`run_reports.sh`, will create the following subdirectories:

- `figures`
- `tex`
- `pdf`

Figures used in the reports will go in the `./figures` directory; all
TeX auxilary files, including primary `.tex` files, will go into the
`./tex` subdirectory; finalized report PDFs will end up in the `./pdf`
subdirectory.
